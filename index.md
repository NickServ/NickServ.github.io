title: About
---

I am a software engineering student at the [Rochester Institute of
Technology](http://www.rit.edu/) and a member of the [Society of Software
Engineers](https://sse.rit.edu/). I currently live on campus. My home town
is Weehawken, New Jersey.

I love working with computers, and am passionate about making great software.
Lately, I enjoy tinkering with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Ruby on
Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/),
front-end web development, [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), and writing
open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
